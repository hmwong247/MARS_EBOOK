## Description of the Project (300 words)
Reflink is a solution to improve e-learning materials. It aims to solve outdated course materials, provide effective materials searching, and relieve stress from students and teachers. Reflink is a teaching tool that links up textbook's content with Youtube videos. It matches the textbook chapter with Youtube video's clips. Users can upload links they found useful, facilitating teaching and encouraging students' peer and self-learning. Our design also follows the rule of an effective e-courseware, allowing students to learn at their own pace with multimedia, embracing individual differences and not forcing every student to learn in the way. It also helps teachers prepare their online teaching materials and keep students concentrated during the lesson. We believe that Reflink with be an excellent teaching and learning tool, making a difference in education.

## 3 Most Impactful Features of the Project (with Screenshot and Short Description (150 words))
1. < Linking Chapters and Videos >Reflink breakdown books into chapters and provide related videos link. Students and teachers can refer to their learning process and watch suitable videos to enhance their understanding or as teaching materials. Multimedia is more accessible for students to absorb knowledge and helps keep lessons attractive. On the other hand, if students watch a video and want text materials or more practice, they can also know which chapter of the textbook they should read.
2. < Timestamp >Most YouTube teaching videos are at least 15 minutes and can go up to 5 hours. Some videos that are published more than 3 years ago usually don't have the chapter function to break down the video. Even if there are, the chapters may not match the teaching of the school's curriculum. Therefore, we also provide a timestamp under each book chapter with the link. Students will no longer have to watch the whole video just to look for one part, and teachers can also know which clip could be their teaching material directly.
3. < Save Book >
We encourage students' self-motivated learning outside the school curriculum. Students can easily save books they need or want to study and view them in their profile.
